## Testing
## Sample Run and Outputs

> ruby measurelatency.rb
Target URL = http://www.google.com.au, Http Response Code = 200, Response Time(in ms) = 255
Target URL = https://www.facebook.com:443, Http Response Code = 200, Response Time(in ms) = 536
getaddrinfo: nodename nor servname provided, or not known
Target URL = https://twitter.com, Http Response Code = 200, Response Time(in ms) = 1104
Target URL = https://www.google.com.au/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=orange, Http Response Code = 200, Response Time(in ms) = 391

This should generate the below output file in JSON format:

> cat responsetime.json
[{"url":"http://www.google.com.au","latency_ms":245,"http_responsecode":"200","error_msg":""},{"url":"https://www.facebook.com:443","latency_ms":599,"http_responsecode":"200","error_msg":""},{"url":"http://www.nonexistentsite.com.au/","latency_ms":0,"http_responsecode":"404","error_msg":"getaddrinfo: nodename nor servname provided, or not known"},{"url":"https://twitter.com","latency_ms":1483,"http_responsecode":"200","error_msg":""},{"url":"https://www.google.com.au/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=orange","latency_ms":616,"http_responsecode":"200","error_msg":""}]
